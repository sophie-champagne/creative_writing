I feel inspired to write something about my recent favorite song: WINE 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grN6DbJfYto ( she has better voice in live version!) 

This song is produced by SUGA, which is also my fav member in BTS (also Namjoon). They are so talented in showing a soft side of woman's feelings. 
The song is in Korean but the lyrics are very sensual and romantic.
