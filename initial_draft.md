Grey 

I come to a place of wasteland 
sunlight is faded 
every living creature is withering 
a complete silence devoid of matter 
nothing is coming to life 

I am waiting for a train
which heads to the unknown 
like our lives
always hesitating at the fork road 
a state of primordial chaos

Like something we eager to fight 
justice and love 
at last we realized that 
there is no absolute black and white 
there is no absolute right or wrong 
only grey 

the least favorite color on earth 
becomes the normality of our life 

Grey is the color of loneliness 
it has no brightness 
only with scale of black and white 
it has no complementary counterpart 
only with itself 
stand alone and against the world 

The passgener of the express train 
heading to unknown 
like throwing a rock into a pond 
after the ripples 
silent as grey
