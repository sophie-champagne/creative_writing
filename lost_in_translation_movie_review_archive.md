Lost in Translation is a movie that reflects deeply on society at large. 
Is real communication often disregarded by, and through, a society’s language and culture?
While the story takes place in Tokyo, it contains a very contrasted backdrop of westerners in Tokyo, arguably the epicenter of eastern culture. One of the main characters, Bob Harris, is a middle-aged man and faded movie star who travelled to Japan to shoot a whiskey commercial in exchange for $2 million. During his time in Tokyo, he met a young newlywed named Charlotte who was with her husband. They ran into each other while staying at the same hotel. Despite their age differences, there was a natural emotional bond between Charlotte and Bob. That was how the story began.

The first half of the movie is filled with chill and dry humor to highlight the problems associated with cultural differences and language barriers. For example, when the Suntory company sent a “Premium Lady” (an escort) to Bob’s hotel room, she insists that Bob “Lip” her stockings. This scene is particularly humorous since her heavy accent prohibits her from properly pronouncing “Rip.” However, it is unclear whether Bob may be thinking that their culture actually does anything called lipping. So, he seemed confused, startled, and annoyed all at the same time.
Such emotional frustration did not end in the hotel room. For example, Bob’s feelings seemed to ebb and flow from confusion and annoyance to frustration during the filming of the commercial. He seemed to be out of his element during the shoots — maybe as a result of feeling left out or not belonging. While Bob was shooting the commercial, the director’s aggressive and verbose manner confounded him. He rarely felt confident in knowing what the director wanted because of the enormous discrepancy between how long-winded the director was yet how extremely brief the translations were. That makes Bob feel uneasy since he thinks the translator is hiding something from him — the resultant of cultural differences, which Bob does not understand.
The primary reason people find it difficult in understanding each other is logical — language and culture. Indeed, trying to fit into a foreign environment and culture can be challenging. It certainly was for Bob and Charlotte. As the story unfolds, a sense of belonging and understanding of each other is critical, not only to Bob and Charlotte but also in human relationships generally. After a long day, they each happened to wander into the hotel bar not knowing of the other’s intention to do the same. Perhaps they were lost, or just tired from a long day in a strange foreign land. Their attempts to blend into their surroundings were futile. Once they each settled into their respective spots in the bar, they each caught a glimpse of the other. We’re not sure if he was looking for company, but he was suffering from a middle-aged crisis and felt loss. He wanted a sense of comfort in a foreign country, and then he met Charlotte. They both shared feelings of loss in different stages.
For Bob, this could be his marriage — for Charlotte, hers too. As Charlotte approached Bob, he playfully said, “Can you keep a secret? I’m trying to organize a prison break. I’m looking for, like, an accomplice. We have to first get out of this bar, then the hotel, then the city, and then the country. Are you in or you out?” Charlotte understood Bob, and it excited her. Bob avoided his marital problems by focusing on other things, like his kids and the rug colors in his home. Charlotte, on the other hand, buried in loneliness in the hotel and was ignored by her busy husband. Both of them felt out of sync with each other’s spouse and lost in each other’s translation. I think this is the point that the director Sofia Coppola wanted to highlight — human being is always hard in understanding each other disregard language and culture. Language is the first weapon that leads isolation and conflict.
Despite the bitterness of loneliness, the movie has a lovely ending. Bob was about to leave. He rushed to Charlotte and whispered something to her ears, kissed her and left. Such sweet scene enhances the movie to another level because it brings imagination and intimacy to whom enjoys the film.
Life is full of transient happiness and stays banal for most of time. However, the glimpse of wonder, like stars in the sky, guiding people moving forward with hope.

To be noted that this movie has the best OST, the music is always on point:
Especially My Bloody Valentine :)
