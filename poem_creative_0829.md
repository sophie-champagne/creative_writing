Ideas Generations: 

Purpose: write a peom about grey, the idea is just fits the tone of adult life color to me. If people's childhood is colorful, then when I became an adult, 
the grey color represents the normal for most of the people. The reason I picked this color is 'boundless' color for me. 
Before, all things seem to black and white for us.Such as Justice would be served, love would be loved. 
However, life is always stays in this unbound state for unknown or not clear state. I hope I can write something 
particularly to express the feeling of waiting, shocked and no control of life. 
However, me as a positive person, I think this undefined 'state' also has a meaning. It taught us how to be patient with ourseleves. Also grey is also 
a kind of struggle state between relationships and self-inner child. I want to express something, grey is the background color of that siliver-lining, without grey, 
there is no siliver-lining. 

Key word: Metamorphosis, unboundless, unknown,shades, depressed,stateless, transitions, regeneration in between
